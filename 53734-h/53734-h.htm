<h2><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>A sitting-room at Isabel’s home</i><br /><br /></h2>


<p><i>Isabel</i> (<i>Isabel, Julia, Hazel busy with Christmas gifts</i>). I suppose, Julia,
you have finished all the Christmas presents that you intend to make this
year. You certainly have been very industrious for the past few weeks.</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Industrious is the right way to put it, Isabel; I certainly have
been very busy. But when this pair of mittens and wristlets that I am
making for Tom are finished, I can say I am through for this year.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Have you made many presents this year, Julia?</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Yes, quite a number of them, Hazel. I don’t remember just how
many, but I surely have been busy.</p>

<p><i>Hazel</i> (<i>teasingly, looking at Julia</i>). I have heard say that it don’t take
much to keep some people busy. For instance, now, there is——</p>

<p><i>Julia</i> (<i>quickly</i>). Now that’s not me, Hazel, not at all. When I work, I
work.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> So does a pump-handle, Julia. But then some one must take hold
of it.</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> I see you girls just want to tease me. Well go ahead, I don’t
care.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Jessie, excitedly, laying aside her wraps.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Well, well! If here isn’t the sluggard at last. We thought you
were never, never, going to come. What detained you so long?</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> (<i>flurried and excitedly</i>). Oh, girls, you couldn’t ever—ever guess.
In a year’s time you couldn’t ever—ever—ever guess.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> An engine down on the railroad crossing?</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> No!—No! (<i>Shaking her head.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Had to wait for your mother to fix your hair, or tie your hair
ribbons?</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> No! No! Oh, girls (<i>holding up hands in surprise</i>) just think of
it! Jerusha Grumble was out sweeping off her walk as I came along
and she looked up and smiled, and said just as pleasant as could be,
“Good afternoon, Jessie.” (<i>All the girls rise quickly and look at Jessie
in astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia</i> (<i>drawls out</i>). She d-i-d?</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> (<i>nodding</i>). U-m. Um—m.</p>

<p><i>Hazel</i> (<i>with emphasis</i>). She—did—indeed?</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i>—Um——. Um-m-m——</p>

<p><i>Isabel</i> (<i>more emphasis</i>). Really—did she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> Um—m. Why, girls, I was never so surprised in all my life.
Jerusha Grumble never spoke so nice to me as she did to-day. I was so
surprised that I really had to stop every few minutes to think about it.
That is one reason why I am so late in coming here.</p>

<p><i>Hazel</i> (<i>girls take seats again</i>). Well, this is a surprise, Jessie, to think
Jerusha took the trouble to speak kindly to one of us girls. I don’t
think she would ever say good afternoon to me, for you know she has
been very angry with me ever since I called her a cranky old maid.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> Dear me. Hazel, you ought not to have said that to her. Jerusha
is cross, and awfully cranky, too, but perhaps there has been something
in her life that has made her dislike every one. I heard father say once,
that Jerusha had a sweetheart a long time ago, and that a girl named
Hannah Takehim won him away from her, and Jerusha hasn’t been like
the same person since. But I really do wish she would be different.</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> She must be getting different, or she wouldn’t have spoken so
nice to me to-day. Do you know, girls, what I was thinking of on my
way here? It was just this. That we four be a committee to go down
to see Jerusha, and invite her to go to the Christmas tree exercises to-morrow
night. Let’s try to get Jerusha out among the people of the village,
and when she sees that we want to be friendly with her, perhaps
she will be different.</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> As likely as not when she sees us come in her gate, she will get
angry and meet us at the door with a broomstick.</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> Never mind how mad she is, we’ll pretend not to notice it, but
all speak pleasantly to her, and gently push our way into the house.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> I am perfectly willing to go, because I would really like to see
Jerusha live like other people, and not be such an unsociable old creature.
Shall we all go girls? I will lead the way.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Yes, we will all go, Hazel.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> We’ll all meet at my house to-morrow afternoon. (<i>All leave for
home with goodbyes, etc.</i>)</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>—<i>Sitting-room at Jerusha’s home</i></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Oil stove in one corner; ironing board in the other. Jerusha’s large
rocker at one side. Jerusha very busy.</i>)</p>


<p><i>Jerusha.</i> Well, Jerusha Grumble, you’re getting awful tired, indeed you
are. But my sakes, how happy you have been to-day. (<i>Seats herself in
rocker.</i>) Here I am just touching on fifty-eight, and all along I’ve acted
like sixty. That is, I’ve acted like some one sixty years old, and not
exactly that either, because most people sixty years old act decent-like
and get some enjoyment out of life. But I always was cross-like, leastwise
ever since Hannah Takehim done what she did. But Hannah’s dead
now, and Jeremiah’s a widower and most blind. Pshaw! them things are
all passed now, and I am going to live like other folks. Dear me, you
don’t just know how good I did feel after I had said good afternoon to
Jessie, yesterday. And how nice she did talk to me, and she said she
hoped I would have a nice Christmas! And after she went on her way,
I just thought to myself, Jerusha, just try and have a real nice Christmas
once, and so I sets to work and made pie and cake, and molasses
candy, and popcorn, and then I thought I would have a Christmas tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
all to myself. Only it ain’t going to be a real tree, but just my new
broom fixed up. When I was a little girl our poor dear mother used
to fix up the broom on Christmas, and we children had lots of fun with
it. You see we were very poor, and mother couldn’t afford to buy a real
tree, so we made the broom answer instead. They are going to have a
real tree up at the church to-night and wouldn’t I like to see it? If I
was like other folks I would go up there. Yes, and I will go, too! Now
I’ll lay out that old print skirt, and when I get time I will press it. (<i>Lays
out the things as she talks.</i>) And I’ll fix my old bonnet over, and I’ll
darn the holes in my black gloves, and go to the Christmas tree to-night.
Now I must write this all down or I will forget about it. (<i>Writes.</i>)
There now! I’ll fix up my own tree first before I do anything else.
(<i>Stands the broom up near her rocker, fixed so that it can be easily
knocked over.</i>) There, I guess that will do. It seems that the more I
do to-day the happier I get. Now I’ll put this popcorn trimming on—and
this ’copia I’ll put on, and yes, I’ll just write Jessie’s name on it, too.
And this handkerchief is for Isabel. And this ribbon is for Julia.
Wouldn’t those girls laugh if they could see my Christmas tree and presents
on it for them? But it ain’t likely they will ever know that I was
so foolish. I have always been so cross and cranky that no one ever
comes here to see me, but I do mean to be different from now on. (<i>As
she finishes fixing up the broom.</i>) There, that does look real nice. Now
I will just sit down and look at it before I get things fixed up for to-night.
(<i>Seats herself in chair and admires the tree.</i>) Jerusha Grumble,
this has been your happiest Christmas since Hannah Takehim....
But as I said before, Hannah’s dead now, and Jeremiah’s a widower and
most blind. (<i>Falls asleep in the chair. Chair placed so she cannot be seen
from door. Girls knock at door. Jerusha does not waken. Girls open
door a little and peep in, but do not see her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Now Hazel, go in. You said that you would lead the way.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Oh, supposing she gets mad and drives us away. You all know
what a cross-patch Jerusha is.</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> Well, girls, all call out, “Merry Christmas, Jerusha,” and then
walk right in and begin to admire everything she has.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> Knock once more on the inside of the door.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Here goes! Are you ready?</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> Yes, Hazel, do for pity’s sake rap hard. Maybe she is upstairs.</p>

<p><i>Hazel</i> (<i>raises her hand to knock</i>). Oh, girls, how can I?</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> You said you would, Hazel, now go ahead. Be quick!</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> All ready, girls. (<i>Raps at the door; no answer. All laugh and
giggle.</i>) She must be out or asleep. I’ll rap again. (<i>Raps again and
waits.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> She may be sick. Let’s go right in. I’ll lead the way if Hazel
won’t.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Oh, do go Jessie, we will all follow you. (<i>All tiptoe in and find
Jerusha asleep. Examine the tree and find the note Jerusha wrote.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> Poor Jerusha is trying to have a Christmas tree all to herself,
and by the way this reminder reads, I should think she was going to fix
up for a visit somewhere.</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> (<i>who has examined the tree</i>). Here is something for each of us
on this broom Christmas tree! I wonder what it means, anyway. Perhaps
Jerusha is trying to live a better life, and if so, then we girls must
help her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Julia</i> (<i>who has been examining the dress, bonnet and gloves</i>). I say, girls,
let’s fix up these things while Jerusha is asleep, and perhaps it will please
her, when she wakes up, to find her work all finished. I will mend the
gloves, and Jessie, you fix up the bonnet, and Hazel can help you, while
Isabel presses out the skirt. Now all work quietly and fast, for she may
soon wake up. (<i>All get to work.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Isabel</i> (<i>admires the skirt, which is of very loud or gay pattern</i>). I guess
Jerusha’s grandmother must have worn this dress. It’s most loud enough
to wake Jerusha out of her sleep. I wonder how long it has been in the
family? (<i>Here Isabel drops the iron on the floor. All frightened. Jessie
places forefinger on her lips. Hazel stands up with one hand over her
mouth and holding bonnet by one string. Isabel holds up both hands and
one foot. Julia, very much frightened, looks at sleeping Jerusha.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> My! but I nearly did it that time, girls. Jerusha is a good sleeper.
I’ll be more careful this time. (<i>Goes on with ironing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> I would put that feather in this way, Jessie, if I were doing it.</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> I think this is the best way, Hazel. Just see how graceful it is!
(<i>Holding up the bonnet.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> My job is done. How about you, Isabel, is that dress pressed out
yet? Oh, how I would like to see you in a dress like that. Do put it
on, Isabel, do now, just for fun.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> What if Jerusha should wake up and catch me with her dress
on? She would be awfully angry. No—no, I can’t do it.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Oh, do put it on, Isabel, and the bonnet, too. We will be as
quiet as mice, and Jerusha won’t know a thing about it. Come, we will
help you with it.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> Well, if you all keep very quiet, I will see how it fits me. (<i>Puts
on the dress and bonnet.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Oh, what a picture you are, Isabel. Just turn around so we can
see you. How sweet you look. Great grandmother, Isabel. (<i>All laugh
and have a good time as Isabel walks around the room. Finally some one
knocks the broom over on Jerusha, who wakes up with a start.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jerusha.</i> Mercy me, what does this mean? Where did you all come
from? Who are you all? Oh, I know you, Hazel! You who called me
a cranky old maid! (<i>Grabs the broom to threaten Hazel.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hazel</i> (<i>very much frightened</i>). Now don’t use your broom on me,
Jerusha. Please don’t. You had it all fixed up for a Christmas tree, and
had presents on it for each of us, and now will you use it to drive us
out of the house.</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> (<i>soothingly to Jerusha, placing hand on her shoulder</i>). Dear
Jerusha, let me explain it all to you. You see we girls came here to
spend the afternoon with you, and we knocked and knocked at the door,
and as you did not answer, we thought that you were sick in bed. So
we came right in and found you asleep, and you looked so tired we
thought that we would let you sleep on, while we fixed up the things you
had laid out for repairs. Now please don’t be angry with us, dear.</p>

<p><i>Jerusha</i> (<i>spies Isabel in the corner with her dress and bonnet on</i>). Isabel,
what are you doing with my dress on? And I declare, but you have
my bonnet, too!</p>

<p><i>Isabel</i> (<i>timidly</i>). Oh, Jerusha, after we got them all fixed up, we thought
we would like to see how they would look. (<i>Admiringly.</i>) Really, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Jerusha, this is a beautiful dress. You don’t see any like it nowadays,
do you, girls? No Jerusha, we meant no offence, so you’ll excuse us,
won’t you?</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> No, Jerusha, we meant no harm. But do please sit down (<i>leads
her to chair</i>), and tell us how you came to make a Christmas tree out of
your broom. And why did you put presents on it for us girls? You must
have had a reason for doing it.</p>

<p><i>Jerusha</i> (<i>sits down, wipes tears from eyes. Julia sits beside her.</i>) Dear
me, girls, I am real glad that you have come, even if you did find me doing
foolish things. But really I ain’t been so happy on Christmas before,
since Hannah Takehim done what she did. But pshaw, Hannah’s dead
now these twenty years, and Jeremiah’s still a widower, but most blind.
But you want to know about the broom Christmas tree, and I will tell you.
You see, when I was a little girl we lived in the city, and we were always
very poor, and when Christmas came we always wanted a tree.
But our mother, with six children, never could afford to buy one for us.
So we always dressed up the broom for a Christmas tree, and what fun
we did have! A few days ago, as I sat by the window, I saw some
men go by with a great big tree for the church, and I thinks to myself,
Jerusha, wouldn’t you like to go to a Christmas exercise once more? And
I said “yes” to myself. But then I thought how mean I had always been
to every one, ever since Hannah Takehim done what she did. But pshaw,
Hannah’s dead this many a year, and Jeremiah’s still a widower. Still,
I says to myself, Jerusha, you must do different, and I just made up my
mind that I will be different, and I will speak pleasant-like to people, and
I would go where the neighbors were, and up to the Christmas tree I
thought was just the place to begin.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> Yes, Jerusha, that will be nice and brave of you to come up to
the Christmas exercises to-night, and one of the reasons why we came
here was to ask you to go up to the church with us. We expect to have
a splendid time. You will come with us, won’t you, Jerusha?</p>

<p><i>Jerusha.</i> I think it is real nice of you, Hazel, to invite me to go, much
nicer than to call me a cranky old maid. (<i>Jerusha reaches for her handkerchief.
Hazel thinks she is reaching for the broom and starts for the
door.</i>) Don’t be afraid, Hazel, no, no, don’t be afraid. I know I was
cranky and mean, but I wouldn’t be an old maid if Hannah Takehim
hadn’t done what she did. But pshaw——</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Jerusha, you haven’t said that you would go with us to the exercises
to-night. We girls would dearly love to have you go. You will
meet a lot of people there that you know.</p>

<p><i>Jerusha.</i> Yes, and a lot that I never liked and who never liked Jerusha
Grumble, either.</p>

<p><i>Isabel.</i> But Jerusha that is just the place to become good friends. You
know that Christmas was the time that the angels sang, “Peace on earth,
good-will toward men.” Now let us make it peace right here in our
own village. You must know Mr. Coutant, and Mr. Bennett and Mr.
Macdonald.</p>

<p><i>Jerusha.</i> Oh, yes, I know all them. Mr. Macdonald is superintendent of
the Sunday-school, ain’t he, Jessie?</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> Yes, my father is the superintendent of the Sunday-school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jerusha.</i> Well, your father is ’most old enough to remember what Hannah
Takehim did. But, oh, pshaw! Hannah’s dead these twenty years,
and Jeremiah’s a widower still, and most blind. And I am just touching
on fifty-eight, so your father will remember. It’s no wonder I am a
cranky old maid. (<i>Hazel starts up again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> Let us all meet at my house, and go up together. I know that
every one will try to make it pleasant for you, Jerusha. We will tell all
our friends that you are coming to the exercises, and they won’t be surprised
when they see you.</p>

<p><i>Hazel.</i> And I know that some young ladies will have a little present on
the tree for you to prove that they appreciate your coming.</p>

<p><i>Isabel</i> (<i>putting on her wraps</i>). Please don’t fix up too much, Jerusha,
for we are all plain people up there and we don’t put on any airs.</p>

<p><i>Jerusha.</i> No, no, I won’t fix up much. I may wear the things you girls
so kindly fixed up for me, and again I may wear my first best ones.</p>

<p><i>Julia</i> (<i>all should now have wraps on to go home</i>). Girls, let’s sing a
Christmas song for Jerusha before we start for home. (<i>All stand in
line, join hands and swing them back and forth child-fashion, while they
sing a verse of some familiar Christmas song. At the second verse, Jerusha
takes her place in the middle of the line and sings and swings with
the girls.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jerusha</i> (<i>near close of second verse says</i>). If only Hannah Takehim
could see me now! But pshaw——</p>

<p><i>Jessie.</i> Merry Christmas, Jerusha. Now be on time. (<i>All say, “Merry
Christmas.”</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jerusha</i> (<i>as the girls are leaving</i>). I’ll be there on time, don’t fear.
(<i>Speaking to the audience.</i>) Now ain’t this been just splendid? And
ain’t those young girls just lovely? I don’t think that Hazel will ever
call me a cranky old maid again. And I do just hope that Jeremiah
will be at the Christmas tree exercises. I’ll just show him that Jerusha
Grumble can go out in society even if I am touching on fifty-eight and
an old maid, which <i>he</i> knows I wouldn’t be if Hannah Takehim hadn’t
done what she did. But pshaw! I must get ready for the Christmas
tree or I will be late, and I think after all that I will wear my first best
clothes, and look real pert—perter than Hannah—but pshaw!</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><b>(+) OLA: OR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MOTHER.</b> In this
little 15-minute play the Christmas present the three children
of the “Good” family find for mother is none other than “Ola,”
a street waif who comes in to get warm while mother is out
shopping. Alta, the only girl in the family, has been wishing
she had a sister to share the trials which two (2) wideawake
brothers bring to her, so she has a double motive in wanting
to hide Ola away when mother comes and then bring her out
and present her as a Christmas present to mother. Only five
characters, 2 boys, 2 girls, and 1 woman, required. No special
costumes needed, and the one home scene is simple to provide.
Five copies required. Price 30 cts., postpaid.</p>


<p><b>(+) MISCHIEVOUS ESTHER AT GRANDMOTHER’S.</b> It was all
Grandmother’s fault. Having so many nice things hidden
about the house at Christmastime should not be permitted,
when the grandchildren are to be left in the house alone
while grandmother goes out for the afternoon. Of course the
boys were not mischievous, not even curious, but with Esther
it was different, for she was a girl. She was a very sweet one
though, especially when the molasses she got into was all over
her apron. It was Christmastime and everything ends right
during this happy season, so putting the soiled apron into the
box from which she took the kitten and putting the kitten into
the wash basin intended for the apron was only a slight mixup,
from which mischievous Esther would soon clear herself.
Three characters, 1 girl and 2 boys, 12 years of age, are employed.
A simple sitting-room scene; no special costumes; time
about 15 minutes. 3 copies only required. Price 25 cts., postpaid.</p>


<p><b>TELEPHONING TO SANTA CLAUS.</b> A Christmas dialogue
for two (2) girls, ten (10) or twelve (12) years of age, who
conceive the idea of using the telephone to tell Santa Claus
what they most want, and suffer no great surprise when the
very things asked for reach them through the “phone.” A
simple sitting-room scene in which a make-believe “phone” is
installed furnishes the setting. Time of rendition about 10
minutes. Price 25 cts., postpaid.</p>


<p><b>(+) WHAT CHRISTMAS DID FOR JERUSHA GRUMBLE.</b> Self-confessedly,
she was only 58, but for years she had acted like
sixty, that is to say,—oh well, in nature she had been true to
her name, and when one’s nature suggests a name like hers,
it’s quite a job to change it. She couldn’t forget that, many
years before, she had expected to change her name, but, oh
well, it wasn’t her fault, and Christmas came along and helped
her to cover up the past and open a new future for her. Of
course it couldn’t change her name, but this little play tells
how very effectively it did change her nature, and then the contrast
between name and nature was a charm in the hitherto
repulsive life. It’s a pretty story, made into a pleasing Christmas
play. There are five characters, all girls; two scenes,
easily arranged. Quite ordinary costumes are used and only
5 copies of the book required. Time about 30 minutes. Price
30 cts., postpaid.</p>


<p><b>(+) WANTED—CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.</b> In Prolog, Three Scenes and
Epilog. By Hester L. Hopkins. 22 females and 13 male characters in
the entire play, but it can be given with 8 females and 7 males by
having some assume different characters in various scenes. Time
of rendition, 30 to 40 minutes. If only 15 people take part, 12 copies
will be required. Price 30 cents per copy, postpaid.</p>


<p><b>(+) CHRISTMAS CHEER.</b> A play in two acts for six females. Time of
rendition about 20 minutes.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four young ladies are the members of a Sunday School class
whose teacher has asked that each member of the class shall do
something to bring “Christmas Cheer” to someone who would not
otherwise be remembered. Each of the girls, unbeknown to the
other members of the class, decides to make the “Jones Family”
the object of her Christmas visit.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be quite a “Surprise party.” While one of the
girls prepares the Christmas pie, the others of the class provide a
pleasant entertainment. When the Christmas pie is cut, Caroline
and Amanda find that it is filled with the presents which the class
brought. Simple setting and costumes. 6 copies required. Price 25
cents. Postpaid.</p></div>

discount of 33⅓ per cent will be allowed from list price on all the above.</i><br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
